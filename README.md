# Python_Coursework
Semester 2 Python Coursework Repository

We can use this shared repository to share blocks of code and any other useful information,
try to save your files in a .py format so we can use them in VSCode or via Jupyter Notebooks.

As none of use are very used to using GitHub,always check with the creator of a specific file 
before making any changes to it, otherwise make changes and save under a different name.
